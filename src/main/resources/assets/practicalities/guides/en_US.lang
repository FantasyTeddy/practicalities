			All of the information in this guide is located in the language file, including recipes and all other information. §oNone§r of it is in the code.
			
			It is based on §oEntries§r, each entry can have many pages, and each page can be of one type. Though at this point only text and recipes are implemented. \
			A page is defined with at least two* lines in the lang file.
			
			§2§oguide.entry.ENTRYNAME.PAGE.type=TYPE
			guide.entry.ENTRYNAME.PAGE=CONTENT§r§0
			
			The type line can be either §otext§r or §orecipe§r, though if it doesn't exist it will default to §otext§r. \
			These formats will be discussed in further detail later.\n\nThe guide book will search forward from page 0->∞ for a plain \
			§2§o...PAGE=SOMETHING§r§0 line to determine the length of the guide, stopping once it finds one missing.

			Recipes consist of 1 (1x1), 4 (2x2), or 9(3x3) items + one result item. The format for an item is as follows

			Any part can be omitted off the end, so specifying the NBT requires also specifying the stack size and damage.

	page.0[
		The only place advanced language files are used are in the guide language files. \
		Guide lang files are not located in the normal §olang§r folder, instead they are located in the §oguides§r folder.
		
		Guide files are only loaded for the currently selected language, or en_US if the language file doesn't exist at all.
		
		If a page is defined in en_US, but not in the currently selected language, it won't appear.
	]
	
	
	page.1[
		Advanced language files have two special things about them, they allow you to nest prefixes and have multiline strings.
		
		§2some.lang.line.{
		¡    item=Text stuff
		¡    sub.{
		¡        item=Another
		¡    }
		¡    text[
		¡        Some long text
		¡        In it.
		¡    ]
		}§0
		
		The previous block translates to the following:
		
		§2some.lang.line.item=Text stuff
		some.lang.line.sub.item=Another
		some.lang.line.text=Some long text\\nIn it.
	]
	
	page.2[
		§lBracket Groups§r
		
		§2tile.mymod.{
		¡    myblock.name=My Block
		¡    mygenerator.name=My Genny
		}§0
		
		Bracket groups allow you to define a common prefix for a region. Such as having all the translations for your blocks \
		start with §2tile.§0 to increase the readability of your language files.
		
		Groups begin with §2trans.late.{§0 and end with a line who's first non-whitespace character is §2}§0. The text before the curly brace \
		is directly prepended to the translations within, meaning most of the time you will want to add a period after the name and before the brace.
	]
	
	page.3[
		§lText Blocks§r
		
		Text blocks allow you to define multiline blocks of text much more easily then you could with a normal lang file. They begin with a line contianing \
		§2some.name[§0 and end with a line who's first character is §2]§0. If you want to begin a line with a §2]§0, add a §2¡§0 character somewhere before it.
		
		Any whitespace you put after a §2¡§0 (upside down exclamation mark) character is safe.
		
		You can wrap lines in a text block without adding newlines by putting a backslash at the end of a line.
		
		§2trans.late[
		¡    Here is a line.
		¡    Here is another line. \ 
		¡    This is on the same line.
		¡    
		¡    Here is a paragraph.
		¡    ¡    This is indented.
		¡    ¡] Brackets are cool!
